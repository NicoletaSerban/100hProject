# Pawsitively Adorable

Pawsitively Adorable in an app for animal lovers looking to adopt or foster animals with a user-friendly interface and extensive database of available animals. The app also offers resources and support for new pet parents, including training tips and veterinarian recommendations. Plus, users can create a profile to share updates.

## Installation

Install PawsitivelyAdorable with npm

```bash
  npm install PawsitivelyAdorable

```

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, EJS, Express, Boostrap, SCSS

**Backend:** Node.js server with Express.js, written using the MVC architecture and MongoDB for database

**Frontend:** Used ejs, Boostrap

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write _something_. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

_(optional)_

You don't have to include this section but interviewers _love_ that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those _whoa this is awesome_ or _fuck yeah I did it!_ moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
